# Spacebook_app

This is the app for Mobile App Development.
It is a Facebook clone made in React Native to create an app for an already made web based service, so an API is used

The code follows the AirBnB guidelines with things such as:

- Wrapping JSX tags in parenthesis when they span more than one line
- Files use PascalCase
- React componenst and variables use camelCase
- Don't pad JSX curly braces
- Leave space at the end of tag with component

Known issue:

- There seems to be an error with a flatlist not scrolling when it is apart of a tab navigator
